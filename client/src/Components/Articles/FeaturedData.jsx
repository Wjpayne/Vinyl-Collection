      album: "Lament",
      description:
        "Touché Amoré have been burrowing through angst, alienation, cancer, and death throughout four adored studio albums. After over a decade of working through darkness, the band’s gorgeously gruff fifth album, Lament, finds the light at the end of the tunnel.

      album: "Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress",
      description:
        "There is so much happening in this wild 16-minute ride of an album. Mysterious Santa Cruz berserkers Gulch bring the icy grandeur of Mayhem, the erratic bloodthirst of Nails, the adrenalized speed of Infest, and a whole lot else. Gulch find strength in anxiety and anger in fear, twisting generations of punk and hardcore and metal into one idiosyncratic personal blur.",
