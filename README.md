[The Blast Beat](https://theblastbeat.herokuapp.com/profile)

This a fully responsive fullstack web Application. I created this App to keep track of the records I own and it turned into a fullstack application. This app features complete user authentication, CRUD capabilites, search filtering, and embedded music players. This is eactly the kind of app I would use on a daily basis.

I have login credentials in the login form if you wish to see a demo.
